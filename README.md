This is a Decentralized Chat App built with Next.js for the frontend and web3.js for interacting with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
Key Technologies:

    Frontend: Next.js
    Blockchain Interaction: web3.js
    Smart Contract Development: Truffle toolkit
    Local Blockchain Testing: Ganache

Note:

Due to issues with obtaining free ETH from faucets, I have not deployed this app to a live Ethereum network. The application is fully functional and can be tested locally using Ganache as the blockchain simulator.

Let me know if youâ€™d like me to include additional details, like how to set up the project or run it locally!
